# Burger-Mania

Burger-Mania is a website for a restaurant in Gothenburg, Sweden. It will help customers to hopefully choose Burger-Mania for their next restaurant-visit. It targets hungry customers who want to eat something tasty and delicious, in the inner city of Gothenburg. Burger-Mania is useful to customers because they can easily find the menu, they can read about the restaurant and how they only use local and organic products, book a table and find were the restaurant is located on a google map.

## Existing features

**Navigation Bar**

- The website has a navigation bar which is full responsive and includes three links to the Logo, Home page, Menu and Book a table page. It is identical on all three pages for easy navigation. On the mobie version it collapses to a menu icon.
  The user can easily navigate between the pages without having to revert back to previous pages via the "back"-button.

**Landing page image**

- The landing includes an image with a burger, overlayed with the text "Craveworthy and made from scratch.", it also contains the text "Visit us in Gothenburg".
  This quickly grabs the users attention and they will scroll down and look for more information.

## Features left to implement

- I would like to add a funktion to make it possible for the user to create an acount and log in.

## Design

**Typography**

- Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:
- Road Rage is used for headings on the site, it is a sans-serif font.
  **Colour**
- I used this color scheme on the website. I think the palette goes well with the theme and gives a cool impression to the user.
